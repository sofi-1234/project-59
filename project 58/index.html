        <div class="line"></div>

        <p class="para">my hobby is reading interseting ,horror and comic books in my free time.whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my homework.I am 12 years old and I read in class 7.Now i know very well that reading is a very good habit which makes me complete.This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.</p>
